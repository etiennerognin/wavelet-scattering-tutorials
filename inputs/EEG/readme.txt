Single electrode EEG data of healthy and epileptic patients

Panwar, Siddharth

Single electrode scalp EEG data for healthy and epileptic patients that mimics the Bonn EEG dataset.

Training data has 5 healthy and 5 epilepsy patients. Each subject has 40 files containing single electrode EEG data.

Test data has 10 healthy and 10 epilepsy patients. Each subject has 20 files containing single electrode EEG data.

The training data for both epileptic and healthy subjects is prefixed with "Train". The letter 'E' denotes epileptic patients and 'H' denotes healthy subjects, followed by patient number, then underscore and file number.
